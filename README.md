Key points to take away from the layout of this website are:

- Using the CSS grid layout to display the images
- Implementing a custom "masonry" layout where the items are of the same height
- Targetting elements using the nth-child pseudo-selector. For this website it involved choosing the 2nd item in each row view and applying a top margin to that item. The row for a small display size contains only two items while for larger display sizes, the row contains three items.
- Placing text to the top right of its parent view and rotating it 90 degrees.
